# creative-agency
This project is about a Fictional Agency 
I used the Grid for the Service page and Flexbox for the Work Page.
In the work Page, I applied a position absolute to the link inside each item to positioning each link inside the
item. Also I applied a nice transition to the opacity and the backgound color on hover.
I use Js for the Hamburger Menu.
The Project is Mobile First, as almost all my project are.
First I start for mobile and then I apply the media queries for tablet and desktop.
Technologies used:
Grid Flexbox Javascript
